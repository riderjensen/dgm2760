-create a form for users to enter in information to create an account with cozycorner (DONE)
-take that data and display the username on the header
-Have users enter in a book, its width in inches, and what is wrong with it (from a drop down) to get a dynamic price each time on repairs.
-create a large class that interacts with a button to display information about a "book of the month"/"show me a random selection"
-maybe create something where users can enter in a type of genre from the drop down and then I can create some javascript variables in the class to append to a general string (ie if they pick murder then I put "spooky" and "dangerous" in a paragraph that is shown)
------Meaning "pick a bookclub you might be interested in" and based on that selection, append words to a general string to get them interested
--still would be nice to figure out how to use APIs in this, maybe something from blizzard can help? IE, call server status and act like each server is a book or author based on the name and then if it is online then the book is in and if it is not online then the book is out?
