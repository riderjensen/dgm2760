(DONE)-create a form for users to enter in information to create an account with cozycorner

(DONE)-take that data and display the username on the header

(DONE) -Have users enter in a book, its width in inches, and what is wrong with it (from a drop down) to get a dynamic price each time on repairs.

(DONE)--still would be nice to figure out how to use APIs in this, maybe something from blizzard can help? IE, call server status and act like each server is a book or author based on the name and then if it is online then the book is in and if it is not online then the book is out?

(DONE) Work on somehow keeping elements past changing pages?

(DONE) Make a cart WITH A MODAL that you can add strings to (aka make a large book list and when they click buy then it appends the string onto the overall checkout list)

-make a redirect page

-create a large class that interacts with a button to display information about a "book of the month"/"show me a random selection"

-maybe create something where users can enter in a type of genre from the drop down and then I can create some javascript variables in the class to append to a general string (ie if they pick murder then I put "spooky" and "dangerous" in a paragraph that is shown)

---Meaning "pick a bookclub you might be interested in" and based on that selection, append words to a general string to get them interested
